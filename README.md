# MaskDemoApp

This repository contains the Android Studio Project of the demo smartphone app implemented for the paper *Face Mask Recognition from Audio: The MASC Database and an Overview on the Mask Challenge* by Mostafa M. Mohamed, Mina A. Nessiem, Anton Batliner, Christian Bergler, Simone Hantke, Maximilian Schmitt, Alice Baird, Adria Mallol-Ragolta, Vincent Karas, Shahin Amiriparian, and Björn W. Schuller.

### Disclaimer

- To work properly, the app needs to send the recorded speech files into a URL endpoint, which returns a *yes* or a *no* string as a result of the model inference.

- The app has been tested on a Xiaomi Mi9 smartphone running Android 9.
